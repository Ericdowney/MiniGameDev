# About Me  

Hey there! Iâ€™m an indie game developer who just took the leap into full-time game dev. Ever since I played *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* on my brotherâ€™s N64 in 1998, I knew I wanted to make games. Itâ€™s been a lifelong dream, and now, Iâ€™m finally making it happen.  

Before going indie, I worked as a software developer for 12 years, building web apps, iOS apps, and backend systems. But no matter what I was working on, I always came back to game development. I love all kinds of gamesâ€”thereâ€™s no single genre I stick toâ€”but the one thing I focus on the most is telling a great story.

This blog is where Iâ€™ll be sharing my journey, posting updates on my projects, and talking about game design. Whether youâ€™re a fellow dev or just someone who loves games, I hope youâ€™ll follow along. ðŸš€
