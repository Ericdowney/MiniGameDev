Hey everyone! As of 2025, I am a full-time indie game dev. I've always wanted to build games, but with a day job, I've never had the time, until now.

Over the past couple of years I've been learning Godot and Unreal Engine. While I have built a couple of small projects in Godot, I decided to switch to Unreal Engine 5 to build my first big projects. While I really enjoyed the Godot engine, I have prior experience with Unreal having used Unreal Engine 3. I also really like the horsepower Unreal Engine gives and the ability to deploy to game consoles.

As of the writing of this article, I have 3 games I want to build in 2025. Two of the three games are going to be set in a fantasy world I've been developing for a couple years now. The third game will be its own standalone game, but I really want to build a couch co-op just like the ones I played as a kid with my friends.

That's the plan! I am going to be writing regular articles here and making videos on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MiniGameDev). So subscribe, bookmark, you know the drill to get all the updates. You can also follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/minigamedev.bsky.social).
